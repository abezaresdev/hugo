      <description>A board (A) represents a place to keep track of information — often for large projects, teams, or workflows.

      <description>The smallest, but most detailed unit of a board is a card (C). Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered, like company vacation policies.

      <description>Lists (B) keep cards, or specific tasks or pieces of information, organized in their various stages of progress. Lists can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across each step in the process from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged and titled however you’d like.</description>

      <description>On the right side of your Trello board is the menu (D)—the mission control center for your board. The menu is where you manage members&amp;rsquo; board permissions, control settings, search cards, enable Power-Ups, and create automations. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu’s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.
Sounds pretty simple, right?</description>
