      <description>Card covers are a delightful yet powerful way of conveying information not only with words, but with color or images. Either as a header or as a full card cover, you can add an image or a color of your choosing to your card front. It will make your boards even more visual and help highlight specific information. We know it: you&amp;rsquo;ll judge the card by its cover.
With the Card Cover button, you can select if you want the cover to be above the card title or take the full height of the card, which will hide the card front.</description>

      <description>Break down your list of cards with a simple line break. Add 3 dashes (‚Äú&amp;mdash;‚Äù) as your card title, and a card separator is born! You can move the separator around between cards as your board evolves and changes.

Click ‚ÄúStickers‚Äù and you‚Äôll see the existing static Trello stickers (which in order to use, you can drag and drop to a card of your choice).</description>

      <description>Nothing is more satisfying than celebrating as a team. The feeling of work getting done and tasks crossing the finish line helps your team feel that all of their efforts have been worth it.
Exult under a rain of confetti when you drag a card to a specific list. Get in on the celebration train by simply placing any one of the following emoji into the title of the list of your choice:</description>

      <description>When getting work done in Trello, make sure to share it with your team so that no one will have to interrupt your workday wondering the status of a task (and also to show how awesome you are, obviously).
Here are a couple of ways you can show off what‚Äôs getting done:
Create a ‚ÄúDone‚Äù list and move cards there when they are completed. It might make sense to create a new ‚ÄúDone‚Äù list of each week for standups and retrospectives.</description>
